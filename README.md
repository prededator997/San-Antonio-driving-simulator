# San-Antonio-driving-simulator
Personal project to try to create simulation of San Antonio traffic to try to find optimization strategies with AI.

First order of business would be to create environment where we could simulate a car moving (or developing/copying code used to simulate just that).

afterwards would come the Ai optimization.
